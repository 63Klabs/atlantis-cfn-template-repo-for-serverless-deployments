  "Description": "Example configuration with PostDeploy stage disabled (default behavior)",
  "UsageNotes": [
    "This configuration demonstrates the default behavior with PostDeploy disabled.",
    "The pipeline will have only 3 stages: Source → Build → Deploy.",
    "No PostDeploy resources (PostDeployServiceRole, PostDeployProject, PostDeployLogGroup)",
    "will be created, reducing infrastructure costs and complexity.",
    "This is suitable for simple applications that don't require post-deployment",
    "validation, testing, or configuration export.",
    "PostDeploy parameters are still present but ignored when PostDeployStageEnabled is false."

  "WhenToUse": [
    "Simple applications without complex post-deployment requirements",
    "Development environments where quick iteration is more important than validation",
    "Cost-sensitive deployments where additional resources should be minimized",
    "Applications that handle all testing and validation in the Build stage",
    "Proof-of-concept or MVP applications with minimal operational requirements"
